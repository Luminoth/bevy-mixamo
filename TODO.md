* show FPS
* load a set of characters and show a dropdown to choose which character
* each character has a list of animations to change to in a drop down
  * make start_idle a more generic play_animation or something
* move all of the loading and character setup to a library for re-use
  * asset event briding probably could be another library to re-use ?
* rotate the model with keybinds
